I want to create a program that will select a given number of sentences from 
a file or a database. It will then display one sentence at a time for me to 
translate to Spanish. I also want to set for how many seconds the sentence will
be shown.

Then I translate the sentence, as soon as I do it I can press a button
(for example "Space"). 

If I press it before the time is up it will then show me
the translation of the sentence and will ask me whether my translation was correct.
I can then press y (correct) or n (incorrect). If I am correct, my score will increase,
if I am incorrect, my score will stay the same. Alternatively I can type it,
it will record and show what I wrote and what translation I have on file

If I don't press a buttom before the time is up, it will show me the translation
and will not increase my score (because I wasn't able to translate it fast enough).

At the end it will show me the score: number of correctly translated sentences
vs the total number of sentences presented. I can also possibly show the list
of all incorrect sentences.

As a prototype I would like to make a simple R script, but eventually I would like
to make a shiny app.

Question: how should I store the sentences? File? Database? These sentences
are based on my learning of Spanish in duolongo, it might be good to label them 
based on the levels in duolongo

So far: labeling the sentences based on the number of lesson: in duolingo these
are the grouped lessons with an image (there could be multiple lessons within
a group). So for example, for the all lessons before posessions, I label the
sentences with 6 (meaning that these sentences come from lessons 1-6). 
Phrases learned from Fluencia I labeled them with 0. When I add posessions these
sentences will be labeled 7 (which means they have words from lessons 1 to 7)
add possession

Also, timing could be an option. Whether I want to the testing to be in the timed
mode or not. The first prototype should be created without timing
